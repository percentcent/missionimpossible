# Cloud-based Twitter Data Analytics System
This is a software system which harvested millions of twitters and analyzed the twitter data for sentiment detection and topic classification. It also includes a web application and web servers that provide data visualization to end-users.
We developed parallel data harvesting and analytics application with virtual machines across the NeCTAR Research Cloud and implemented a cluster CouchDB to store and process huge data, using MapReduce approaches for analytics, Ansible for scripted deployment and error handling techniques.
